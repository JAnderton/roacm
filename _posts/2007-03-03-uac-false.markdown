So finally I got bugged with UAC enough to switch it off a few weeks back. Not all of it though. Just the module for approval from an admin and the elevation without prompting. Here is how you can do it.

Click Start > Type "local" and enter (to open Local Security Policy) > Local Policies > Security Options > Browse down to the set of UAC controls.

Now I disabled the "User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account" and set the "User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode" to "Elevate without prompting"

So far, everything is going quite smoothly. Then to disable the irritating red icon in your task bar open Windows Security Center (again start > type it out and select. Don't you just love Windows Vista's new search? ;)) then on the left side, select "Change the way Security Center alerts me."
Now select "Don't notify me and not show me the icon (not recommended)" I would have honestly liked an option saying, "Notify me (once) but don't show me the icon." Too bad we can't do that.

And that is it. No more UAC asking you to accept every action you make. Yay for power users ;)
