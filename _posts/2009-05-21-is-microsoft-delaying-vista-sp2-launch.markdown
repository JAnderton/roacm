Microsoft is usually [eager to release updates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) to its products. I have been seeing Vista SP2 news and downloadable links all over the internets. Release Candidates have been around for a while now but I never got any of them because I didn't want to spend an hour or so on the update (that's how long SP1 took to install) and then possibly have to do it again when the final SP2 comes out. I was just waiting for Microsoft to push SP2 through Windows Update.

Microsoft **has** come up with the RTM for Vista SP2. They have asked manufacturers to start shipping with Vista SP2 until 7 comes out. But they seem to want to hold off the release (for some reason not clear to me) until the original release estimate they had given, the end of Q2 (end of June).

May be it has something to do with what Bill Veghte had to say..


<blockquote>"If you're just starting your testing of Vista, with the release candidate and the quality of that offering, I would switch over and do your testing on the release candidate, and use that going forward."

So I'm guessing Microsoft wants to push Windows 7 further. They are marketting it towards that set of population which didn't like Vista, either because of the [Mojave factor](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mojave-experiment/) or its "high" hardware requirements (mostly the former I presume). As for organizations, if XP legacy is an issue, surely [Windows 7's XP Mode](http://karunab.com/2009/05/16/windows-7-a-second-look/) is there to help ;)




I still feel Vista doesn't get its due credit, may be not as bad as [Windows ME](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080318/windows-me-deserve-more-respect/) but Vista does deserve more credit. Most techies will tell you how much they love Vista but most laymen users generally prefer XP. I for one haven't had many compatibility issues, nothing [Compatibility Mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_mode) [didn't solve](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/).




I like Windows 7 but at least for now, I shall still be in love with Windows Vista despite my systems having already moved to Windows 7. For its time, it was a truly great OS. It had tid bits of features that gave users a better UX and simultaneously had showstoppers to provide the [WOW effect](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/flip-3d.aspx) ;)




The one last machine I have on Vista is going to updated with SP2 tonight. I suggest you do the same :)
