Yes, they are out! You might have been hearing about the two for the past week or two around the interneticle blogosphere. I certainly did and as with every VS release, I was excited. VS is the best IDE I have seen so its no surprise that a new release excites me.

Initial reports state that the editor now uses WPF at points, has a brand new editor and improvements in syntaxes. Another thing they have changed is VS 2010 now has native support for F# :o This release isn't really high on performance and optimization but gives you a good look as to where this project is going. Seems really exciting the things they have done. You can have a look at the [Visual Studio 2010 Training Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=752cb725-969b-4732-a383-ed5740f02e93&displayLang=en) VS 2010 TS B1 :)

All this and much more in this release. I'll have an initial review up by tonight when I get my hands on it.

People who are waiting to download it can do so off MSDN Premium, [Microsoft Downloads](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=255fc5f1-15af-4fe7-be4d-263a2621144b&displaylang=en) or try the [Web Installer](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=85520793-68fc-4361-a8b6-dc2cff49c8d2&displaylang=en). I'm sure there are other not so legal ways to do it as well :P If you are looking for a x64 VS 2010 Team System then don't. There isn't one :( So its x86 for all of us! Don't worry, the following OS' are supported:



	
  * Windows 7 RC (x86 and x64) Ultimate Edition

	
  * Windows Vista (x86 or x64), all editions except Starter Edition

	
  * Windows XP (x86 or x64), Service Pack 2 or later, all editions except Starter Edition

	
  * Windows Server 2003 (x86 or x64), Service Pack 1 or later, all editions

	
  * Windows Server 2003 R2 or later (x86 or x64), all editions

	
  * Windows Server 2008 (x86 and x64) or later (all editions)

	
  * Windows Server 2008 R2 RC (x64) Enterprise Edition


Windows 7 might be supported in this release but Microsoft doesn't really recommend using VS 2010 B1 on Win7. Why? I guess as with most betas, you want bug reports that are purely based on your product. Two betas working together could do a lot more weirder things than just one.

If you already have Visual Studio 2008 on your machine then don't worry, VS 2010 B1 will install beside it without disturbing your precious VS 08 install ;) As with any beta, don't rely on it for your major dev work and avoid installs on your primary machine.
