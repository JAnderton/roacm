Windows 7 Launch Party is a party organized by individuals in their homes, offices or other commercial venues celebrating the launch of Windows 7 and showing off its prowess. Its being done through the [House Party website](http://www.houseparty.com/) and the only reason its not called that is because Microsoft didn't want to restrict the venue to homes. Great PR is what I say.

Why am I giving you stale news? Well, this isn't really news but I applied around the first week of September got selected first as a candidate host then got a confirmed host status. Last night I got an e-mail stating my party package is on its way.

All hosts will receive:



	
  * One limited Signature Edition Windows® 7 Ultimate

	
  * One Puzzle with Windows® 7 Desktop Design

	
  * One Poster with Windows® 7 Desktop Design

	
  * Ten Tote Bags with Windows® 7 Desktop Design for hosts and guests

	
  * One table top centerpiece for decoration

	
  * One package of Windows® 7 napkins


The package should arrive by this Tuesday or Wednesday. The party is planned for the 23rd of October at 7.00 PM and is an invite only party. So drop in a line and I'll try to get people in :) After all, my room can only fit that many people in.. :P
