You might have heard about [Messenger Plus! Live](http://msgpluslive.net), a Windows Live Messenger add-on that has over 62 million users already. I've been on their [support forum](http://msghelp.net) for nearly 5 years now and been a beta tester for nearly 2 years.

Early on the morning of the 27th of October I stumbled upon a thread simply titled "[New Elite Members](http://msghelp.net/showthread.php?tid=92693)" and I found this interesting since it was the first time in my 5 years on the forum that new additions to the staff were being made. I opened it to see who the lucky people were. I expected a couple of lads to be added but the list had more like 12 people.

The first 3 people were all ones I knew so I skipped straight to the bottom of the page to leave a congratulatory message for them. After typing that out, I continued reading the page and to my surprise **I found my name on it** :-|

I was absolutely shocked. I have spent a lot of time on the forum but over the past couple of years, my post count really hasn't moved much more than a couple of hundred. I do however spend a couple of hours every day helping out on the Messenger Plus! IRC support channel but I didn't really think any one noticed.

I must say, I am absolutely honored. The decision was made by the staff and for the fool who voted for me, I have to say "HAHA.. you totally wasted your vote :p". But seriously, thanks a lot guys. Feels good to be part of the "[staff](http://msghelp.net/showteam.php)" of a forum with over 85,000 users for a software which has over 62 million users.

The forum and IRC have given me a lot. They have taught me most of the things I know, give me loads of friends and great experiences. And then to be made an Elite Member.. it's an honor.
