If you suffer from reception issues on your WiFi connection and would like a boost to your router/access point, you should try out this easy tutorial I read online. It's free and really simple on following up. All you need is some aluminium foil, card board, glue for sticking stuff and a scissor/blade for some cutting.

It's so easy (and cheap) to build, it would be silly not to try it out before considering actually paying for a booster on your WiFi router.

I suggest you go check out the [Ez-10 Corner Reflector](http://freeantennas.com/projects/Ez-10/). I found it thanks to [this video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBfxbpxosA) :)

I don't really need it but considering the minimal effort required, I will try it out and see how useful it is. If you do so, drop in a word ;)
