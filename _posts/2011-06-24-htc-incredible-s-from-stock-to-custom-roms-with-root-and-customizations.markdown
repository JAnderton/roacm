I've been dabbling around a lot with Android customizations from my HTC Incredible S which I recently took from HTC's India ROM to Android Revolution HD ;) Along the way, I S-Offed my phone and rooted it as well.

If you're wondering how to how to do this transition or having issues using AlphaRevX, feel free to read up my extremely long writeup of this process on the XDA-Developers forum which has given so much to so many ;)

The tutorial takes you from your HTC Sense default ROM on your HTC Incredible S to S-Offing your phone, getting recovery by installing ClockWorkMod (CWM),Â rooting your phone and to finally installing a custom ROM yourself ;)
