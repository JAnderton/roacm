For those of you who don't know what Spotify is, it's a great music streaming site which allows free streaming to your PC and great streaming/offline music play on your mobile device.

So, have you been waiting years to create your Spotify account? Here's a way to easily get a free spotify invite and register yourself:


1. [Click this link to get your invite](http://klout.com/perk/Spotify/SpotifyFreeAccounts?passalong=MzEvNzQyMDk4LzI&passalongSig=76e22145b5aa3b7516ad44c56f1a91acec4d53ca3e39b84393f519dfe98bd025). This facility is only available to Klout users so all you have to do is sign in with your Twitter/Facebook account and you'll be good to go! <del>(Alternately you can comment here with your proper e-mail address in the e-mail field or any other contact details and I'd be happy to invite you :))</del> I'm out of invites so Klout is the only way to get them :(
2. Head on over to a proxy such as [Hide My Ass](http://hidemyass.com) and go to the [registration page](https://www.spotify.com/us/invitation/) (https://www.spotify.com/us/invitation/). Attempting to register from a country which is banned will not work.
3. Complete the registration and download the Spotify installer for your platform.
4. Run the installer and start spotify.
5. Login and enjoy music bliss! ;)




Hope this is helpful!
