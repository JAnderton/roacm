If you want Eclipse to integrate well with GitHub (I know there are millions of tutorials out there), you should really follow the [tutorial for EGit](http://www.vogella.de/articles/EGit/article.html) and make sure you have [Git set up on your Windows machine](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/) **first**!
