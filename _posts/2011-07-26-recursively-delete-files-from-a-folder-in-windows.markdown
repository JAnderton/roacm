This is something one might need to do regularly. I need to because [wget](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) often creates multiple index.html@* files despite being set up not to (my GUI for wget might forget configs.. who knows?)

I'm left with a couple of hundred folders with 6 html files each which to me is quite irritating. So here's a simple command to delete files in Windows recursively.


del /S **index.html@***


****Change the "index.html@*" part to anything else you might want. Obviously, wild cards are valid. Have fun and be careful! :)
