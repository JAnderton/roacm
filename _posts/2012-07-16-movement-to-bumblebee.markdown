I finally took the time out to move away from shared hosting into my own server. It's been a long time coming but it's finally here! I hope this will stop issues for Wordpress caused by shared hosting. If it doesn't, it's out with Wordpress :)

I ported over data and my database after cleaning up the infections. I have, however lost some of the uploaded images from my past posts so any issues there are regretted :( These images are gone from my Dreamhost server and hence can't be ported over.. oh well :'(

Thanks once again to those who helped me with Dreamhost.. let's welcome the movement to our very own server, Bumblebee! :)
