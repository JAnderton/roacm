If you're having issues buying anything on XBox 360 and doesn't even let you login to xbox.com and it keeps kicking you out, there is a chance that one of the credit cards you have stored on record is invalid.

If you read the [XBox help on how to remove a payment option](http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/manage-payment-options/remove-xbox-live-payment-option), they ask you to go to "Payment & Billing" and this site won't be accessible either.

Your best bet is to go to [commerce.microsoft.com](https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/PaymentInstrument) and then to their "payment options" page. Here, you will see your credit card. Click on it and click remove. Add a new payment option if you please. After this, you should be able to access xbox.com and buy things on your xbox
