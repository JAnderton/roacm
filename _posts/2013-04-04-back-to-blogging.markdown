I realize that over the past 3 and a half years I haven't blogged as much as I used it. It's not because I had nothing to say but was mainly because most things I had worked on were things I wasn't allowed to talk about in public (thanks to NDAs and policies I needed to abide by). Since then, I've moved out of my previous organization and shall soon start working at a new place. Though the NDAs will continue, I am still allowed to pass along general learnings, which I'm keen to do.

More posts, coming soon!
