Oh yes, it's time I started uploading some of my old code to github. It's something I've wanted to do for a while. For those unaware, I use Soccer Scraper to quickly view Manchester United's schedule in IST.Â The base source code (circa 2008+minor fixes) is now on GitHub.

There are tons of things that need to be made configurable but first, I'd rather finish the SMS code that I had partly developed a while back along with the functional e-mail notification script. The only issue with the SMS functionality code is that it's not stable since I scrape data onto the provider's site (since they don't provide a proper API :( oh well..). Once I get this working well, I'll upload the SMS source code along with instructions on how I run it.
