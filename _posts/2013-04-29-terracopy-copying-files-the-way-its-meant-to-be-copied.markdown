TeraCopy is an amazing tool for Windows which allows users to queue up copy requests, pause them, re-order them and change copy file lists at run time. It's got a lot of power and great integration with Windows. It's a tool which I highly recommend.

Go [check it out](http://codesector.com/teracopy)! I bet that you'll love it so much that you wouldn't mind paying $20 for it! ;)
