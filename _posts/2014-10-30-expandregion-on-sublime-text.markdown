Once you get used to the [JetBrains suite of IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) pressing [Cmd/Ctrl+W for expanding selection becomes second nature](http://paulhammant.com/2014/02/07/jetbrains-ides-their-best-feature-is-control-w/). This leads to closing tabs on most applications such as text editors which is of little consequence since you can train yourself to use a different short cut.

My favourite text editor ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)) does not have this feature built in but it seems I'm not the only one who misses the expand region feature. Go grab your copy of [ExpandRegion by Aron Woost from GitHub](https://github.com/aronwoost/sublime-expand-region) with full instructions on how to install on Windows, Linux and Mac.
