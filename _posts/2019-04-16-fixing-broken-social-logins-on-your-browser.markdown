Privacy vs Convienience is a constant battle. Personally, I prefer dialing up my privacy up to 11 to avoid being tracked. Every once in a while, _social logins_ are important because it's the only way to use a service. If this service is an internal company login that only uses social login via the company's Google ID, you don't have much of a chance.

If your login just won't work, try changing the following settings

{{ site.excerpt_separator }}

## Privacy Badger
Allow calls to `accounts.google.com` & `apis.google.com`

## Firefox settings
Allow Third party trackers in Firefox through Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies > Third-party trackers
