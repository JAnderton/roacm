Hi there stranger!

I'm [Karun Japhet]({{site.bio_url}}) and this is my de**vlog** for all the weird things I do on the computer that randomers in the distant future might be interested in :) Essentially this site keeps track of all the technical work I do myself (I try to keep group projects out of here as much as possible :P) Hopefully someday the list will grow large. You might notice that I also post a lot about small scripts or utility commands on Windows/Linux that I often talk about. The reason is that I'd like to have them noted down for future reference :) Makes them easier to find ;)

It is true that this used to be the home of my custom CMS (j@x) but due to lack of time to develop it further, I decided to move to an off the shelf system (WordPress) at least for the <del>near</del> foreseeable future.
Towards the end of 2015, this blog was moved to Octopress.

Feel free to catch up with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_user}}) or [Facebook](https://facebook.com/{{site.facebook_user}}) ;) Did you check out [my portfolio page yet]({{site.bio_url}})?
