Some of us love having huge number of high quality wallpapers to rotate through. The search for such a need is continuous and on going. There are many sources out there and one of the famous ones is [Desktoppr](https://www.desktoppr.co/). It's got a set of high quality images with a [pretty simple to use API](https://www.desktoppr.co/api#wallpapers) making it simple for developers to utilize it.

They sync wallpapers to dropbox allowing you to get images automatically on your machine. But if you're like me and don't have free space on your dropbox account, you might want to download images directly. In such a case you can use [Desktoprr Downloader](https://github.com/javatarz/desktoppr-downloader), a script that downloads images which are at least your resolution and of the same aspect ratio to your machine. Post this, you can tell your Windows/Mac (Linux too if your distribution has the rotating wallpapers feature built in)

It's a work in development and more features will be added as time goes on. I'd be more than happy to take suggestions. :)
