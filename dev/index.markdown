Life as a developer on contract means you spend most of your time building things you can't tell others. There are always those others that are private projects you don't want to necessarily expose to the outside world. Here are some that I have shared in the past. Some of these, since they are old, might lead to dead links. If reported, I can look into fixing it if possible. :)

If you want to view all posts related to development, you need to look at the [Development Category page](http://karunab.com/category/dev/) as it will contain version by version updates whilst this is a compilation of all projects I can publicly disclose.
