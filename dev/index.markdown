Here are some open source and/or public projects I've taken up in the past.

  * [Desktoppr Downloader]({{ site.url }}/dev/desktoppr-downloader/)
  * [File List Generator]({{ site.url }}/dev/file-list-generator/)
  * [Enpower](http://enpower.us/) (Microsoft Imagine Cup 2008 Interoperability Award Winning Entry) (Owned by [Creative Riot Software](http://creativeriot.com/))

Projects no longer supported:

  * [Soccer Scraper]({{ site.url }}/dev/soccer-scraper/)
  * [IMdB Movie Comparison] (Web Service for IRC) (Not supported)
  * MARS (Management Attendance Record System) (Removed)
  * CountPrime (Removed)
  * Uptime Challenge (Plus! script)
  * WordPress [Emote Pack]({{ site.url }}/dev/wordpress-emote-pack)

If you want to view all posts related to development, you need to look at the [Development Category page]({{ site.url }}/blog/categories/development/) as it will contain version by version updates whilst this is a compilation of all projects I can publicly disclose.

## Dead Links
Please leave me a comment below if you see a dead link. I'll update the page to ensure it's fixed.
