If you're like me, you'll have tons of wallpapers that you download from sources such as [4scrape](http://suigintou.desudesudesu.org/4scrape/) and [InterfaceLIFT](http://interfacelift.com) and most of the time you want to change a wallpaper but not actually go through the process of selecting one of the thousands of wallpapers that you have.

In this case you either download an application (like this one) for randomly changing wallpapers or use Windows 7's inbuilt multiple wallpaper selection feature. I wanted something a bit more specific. I like to keep a single wallpaper until I'm bored with it. I didn't want a software which could do a million things. Just do one thing for me, select a wallpaper and set it to desktop.

Solution: Write your own Random Selection Wallpaper Changer (RSWC)

As mentioned earlier, its a simplistic application because its meant to be. It gets all images (jpg, bmp and png), selects a random one and sets it as your wallpaper.

**Download [RSWC](http://karunab.com/dls/Random Selection Wallpaper Changer v1.00.exe)**


## Version History




### v1.10





	
  * Added: _folder (path)_ selection option

	
  * Added: _mode_ selection option

	
  * Added: _png_ support

	
  * Fixed: Error handling when empty folder is selected




### v1.00





	
  * Initial Release

	
  * Support for _jpg_ and _bmp_

	
  * Default _folder (path) _set to _My Pictures_

	
  * Default _mode_ set to _Stretched_




## Expansion Ideas:





	
  * Desktop context menu integration for direct wallpaper change calls though this would mean the application would no longer be portable. This could be a separate add-on to the application.

	
  * Port to non managed code (some day)

	
  * File size reduction




**Update (14/07/2011):**Â This project has been dead for a while. I do not possess the source code for this any more. This page is up for simply tracking purposes. Download to 1.00 is still available. Couldn't find the 1.10 executable.
