It replaces the copy of functions.php that WordPress provides with the new file and provides a set of emotes with it. It contains emotes from MSN Messenger, yaBB and some other emote packs. Thanks to the emote collection pack on [MsgHelp.net](http://msghelp.net/images/smilies/index.php). Please read the read me for more info.

This file has been updated to the functions.php included with **WordPress 2.6**

Currently there are two ways to use this pack.



	
  1. **functions.php replace method**: Download [WPEP](http://karunab.com/dls/WPEP.zip) and follow the instructions in the readme to install it. It includes replacing of the functions.php for your WordBress blog. Current functions.php version is from WordPress 2.6. If you have a different WordPress version, please take the array of emotes and replace the list in your functions.php :)

	
  2. **Plugin method**: This method is rather safer and involves you installing the plugin [Custom Smilies](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-smilies/) and downloading the Smileys only version of WPEP ([WPEP-SOv](http://karunab.com/dls/WPEP(SOv).zip)) and following the instructions in the read me. It involves you uploading the smiley set and then adding your own emote hot keys.


If you aren't comfortable with editing files, I'd suggest the plugin method since its rather straight forward. Also, doing so gives you all the features of the plugin which include a nice like emote selection bar if you're into that sort of thing ;)
